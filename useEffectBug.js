This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a callback function that attempts to modify state asynchronously using `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, or similar methods.  The component might unmount before the asynchronous operation completes, leading to a warning or error because the component is no longer mounted. The error message might not always be explicit about the asynchronous operation causing the problem.
